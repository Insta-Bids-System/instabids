# Agent 1 - Messaging System Build and Test Plan
**Date**: August 4, 2025
**Agent**: Claude Agent 1 (Frontend Flow)
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Build and test a **COMPLETE** messaging system between homeowners and contractors with:
- Real database users (not hardcoded test data)
- Full conversation flow through bid cards

- [x] Test conversation retrieval after browser refresh

### Phase 3: File Upload Implementation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Check existing Supabase storage buckets and image upload systems
- [x] Build image upload endpoint (`POST /api/messages/upload-image`)
- [x] Build document upload endpoint (`POST /api/messages/upload-document`)
- [x] Create/verify `message_attachments` table schema
- [x] Fix database foreign key constraints and storage policies
- [x] Test image upload with real message IDs
- [x] Test document upload with real message IDs
- [x] Verify attachments are properly linked to messages
- [ ] Update messaging UI to support file attachments
- [ ] Implement file preview/download functionality

### Phase 4: Complete Integration Testing ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Test image upload in conversation
- [x] Test document upload in conversation  
- [x] Verify attachments persist with messages

- [x] Test complete multimedia message flow (text + image + document)
- [x] Verify file accessibility via public URLs
- [x] Test contractor response to multimedia messages
- [x] Confirm conversation persistence after file uploads

### Phase 5: Bid Card Lifecycle Testing 🚧 PENDING
- [ ] Create new bid card for testing
- [ ] Link conversation to bid card
- [ ] Test message persistence through bid card status changes
- [ ] Verify conversation survives bid card completion
- [ ] Test conversation history access

## 🧪 TEST CRITERIA

### User Authentication Test
```sql
-- Must pass: Real users exist
SELECT 'homeowner' as type, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM homeowners 
WHERE user_id = '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'contractor' as type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM contractors
WHERE id = '22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222';
-- Expected: Both counts = 1
```

### Message Persistence Test
```sql
-- Must pass: Messages save to database
SELECT COUNT(*) as message_count,
       COUNT(DISTINCT sender_type) as sender_types,
       MIN(created_at) as first_message,
       MAX(created_at) as last_message
FROM messaging_system_messages
WHERE conversation_id = '{conversation_id}';
-- Expected: message_count >= 5, sender_types = 2
```

### File Attachment Test
```sql
-- Must pass: Attachments linked to messages
SELECT m.id as message_id,
       m.filtered_content,
       COUNT(a.id) as attachment_count,
       STRING_AGG(a.type, ', ') as attachment_types
FROM messaging_system_messages m
LEFT JOIN message_attachments a ON m.id = a.message_id
WHERE m.conversation_id = '{conversation_id}'
GROUP BY m.id, m.filtered_content
HAVING COUNT(a.id) > 0;
-- Expected: At least 1 message with attachments
```

### Conversation Completeness Test
```bash
# Must pass: Complete conversation flow
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8008/api/messages/{conversation_id}" | jq '.messages | length'
# Expected: >= 5 messages

curl -X GET "http://localhost:8008/api/messages/{conversation_id}" | jq '.messages | map(.sender_type) | unique | length'  
# Expected: 2 (both homeowner and contractor)
```

3. **File Attachments**: Images and documents can be shared
4. **Database Persistence**: Everything survives server restarts
5. **Bid Card Integration**: Messages tied to specific projects
