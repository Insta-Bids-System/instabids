# InstaBids - Multi-Agent Development Router
**Last Updated**: January 30, 2025  
**Purpose**: Direct agents to their specialized development domains

## 🚨 **AGENT IDENTIFICATION REQUIRED**

**STOP**: Before proceeding, identify which agent you are and read your specialized file:

### **🤖 AGENT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM**

**HOW IT WORKS**: 
1. Pick which agent you are (1-5)
2. Read your ONE agent file in `agent_specifications/`
3. That's it - everything you need is in that file

**AGENT FILES**:
- **Agent 1**: `agent_specifications/CLAUDE_AGENT_1_FRONTEND_FLOW.md`
- **Agent 2**: `agent_specifications/CLAUDE_AGENT_2_BACKEND_CORE.md`
  - Extra docs: `agent_specifications/agent_2_backend_docs/`
- **Agent 3**: `agent_specifications/CLAUDE_AGENT_3_HOMEOWNER_UX.md`
  - Extra docs: `agent_specifications/agent_3_homeowner_docs/`
- **Agent 4**: `agent_specifications/CLAUDE_AGENT_4_CONTRACTOR_UX.md`
- **Agent 5**: `agent_specifications/CLAUDE_AGENT_5_MARKETING_GROWTH.md`

**QUICK REFERENCE**:
- Agent 1 = Frontend (homeowner chat + bid cards)
- Agent 2 = Backend (contractor discovery + outreach)
- Agent 3 = Homeowner UX (dashboards + Iris)
- Agent 4 = Contractor UX (portal + bidding)
- Agent 5 = Marketing (growth + referrals)

### ✅ NEW: TIMING & ORCHESTRATION SYSTEM COMPLETE (January 30, 2025) ✅ FULLY TESTED
- **Timing & Probability Engine**: ✅ COMPLETE & TESTED - Calculates contractors using 5/10/15 rule
- **Check-in System**: ✅ COMPLETE & TESTED - Monitors at 25%, 50%, 75% of timeline
- **Escalation Logic**: ✅ COMPLETE & TESTED - Auto-adds contractors when below targets
- **Enhanced Orchestrator**: ✅ COMPLETE & TESTED - Fully integrated intelligent campaigns

**Test Results**: ALL 5 COMPONENTS PASSED COMPREHENSIVE TESTING ✅
- Timing & Probability Engine: ✅ PASS
- Check-in Manager: ✅ PASS  
- Enhanced Orchestrator: ✅ PASS
- Database Integration: ✅ PASS
- End-to-End Flow: ✅ PASS

**New Files Created & Tested**:
- `agents/orchestration/timing_probability_engine.py` - Core calculations ✅ TESTED
- `agents/orchestration/check_in_manager.py` - Monitoring & escalation ✅ TESTED
- `agents/orchestration/enhanced_campaign_orchestrator.py` - Integration ✅ TESTED
- `test_timing_system_complete.py` - Comprehensive test suite ✅ PASSES

**How It Works**: System uses MATH & RULES (not LLMs) for timing:
- Mathematical formulas for contractor calculations (Response rates: 90%/50%/33%)
- Database queries for availability (Tier 1/2/3 contractors)
- Threshold-based escalations (25%, 50%, 75% check-ins)
- Auto-scaling contractor outreach when behind targets
- LLMs only used for conversation understanding and message writing

**Example Business Logic Working**:
```
User needs 4 bids in 6 hours (URGENT timeline)
System calculates: 3 Tier1 + 5 Tier2 + 0 Tier3 = 8 contractors
Expected responses: 4.4 (exceeds 4 bid target)
Check-ins scheduled: 1.5hrs, 3hrs, 4.5hrs
Confidence: 100%
```

**Test Command**: `cd ai-agents && python test_timing_system_complete.py`

## 🆕 MULTI-PROJECT MEMORY SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION

### Architecture Overview
The multi-project memory system enables AI agents to maintain persistent memory across different user projects while keeping project contexts separate. This creates a more intelligent, personalized experience.

### Key Components

#### 1. Database Schema (3 New Tables)
- **user_memories**: Cross-project user preferences (budgets, communication style)
- **project_summaries**: AI-generated summaries of each project
- **project_contexts**: Project-specific conversation state and context

#### 2. Memory Store (`ai-agents/memory/multi_project_store.py`)
Core class that handles all memory operations:
```python
store = MultiProjectMemoryStore()
await store.save_user_memory(user_id, "budget_preferences", data)
await store.get_cross_project_context(user_id, project_id)
```

#### 3. LangGraph Integration (`ai-agents/memory/langgraph_integration.py`)
Provides project-aware agent initialization:
```python
config = await setup_project_aware_agent(user_id, project_id, session_id)
await update_agent_memory_after_conversation(...)
```

#### 4. Updated CIA Agent
The CIA agent now accepts a `project_id` parameter and automatically:
- Loads cross-project context when starting conversations
- Updates memory after each interaction
- Provides project-aware responses

### How It Works

1. **User starts conversation about lawn care**
   - CIA saves budget preference: $150-200/month
   - Creates project context for lawn maintenance
   
2. **User later asks about kitchen remodel**
   - CIA loads user's budget history
   - Can intelligently reference other projects
   - Maintains separate context for kitchen project

3. **User mentions gutter cleaning**
   - CIA asks: "Would you like to add this to your lawn maintenance project?"
   - Shows awareness of existing projects and relationships

### API Integration

#### Project Management Endpoints
```python
POST /api/projects              # Create new project
GET /api/projects/{user_id}     # List user's projects  
GET /api/projects/{project_id}  # Get project details
PUT /api/projects/{project_id}  # Update project
DELETE /api/projects/{project_id} # Delete project
```

#### Memory Access in Agents
```python
# In any agent's handle_conversation method:
result = await cia.handle_conversation(
    user_id=user_id,
    message=message,
    project_id=project_id  # Optional - enables project awareness
)
```

### Testing & Verification
All components have been tested with real Claude Opus 4 API calls and verified to work correctly:
- User preferences persist across projects ✅
- Project contexts remain isolated ✅
- Cross-project awareness demonstrated ✅
- Backend storage confirmed working ✅

- **Timing Engine** - Response orchestration ✅ COMPLETE
- **Probability Calculator** - Success rate tracking ✅ COMPLETE
- **Check-in System** - Automated monitoring ✅ COMPLETE
- **Escalation Manager** - Auto-add contractors ✅ COMPLETE

## 🔧 TECHNICAL STACK
- **Backend**: FastAPI on port 8008 (⚠️ NOT 8003)
- **Database**: Supabase (33 tables)
- **AI**: Claude Opus 4 for all intelligent decisions
- **Agent Framework**: LangGraph for all backend agents
- **Automation**: Playwright for website forms
- **Frontend**: React + Vite on port 5173 (NOT 3000)

## 🛠️ CRITICAL CODING GUIDELINES

### ⚠️ BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE:
1. **ALWAYS use the refMCP tool** (`mcp__ref__ref_search_documentation`) to get latest documentation
2. **Search for relevant docs** before implementing any feature
3. **Check existing patterns** in the codebase first

### Backend Development:
- **Framework**: All agents use LangGraph (Python)
- **Pattern**: Each agent has `agent.py`, `prompts.py`, `state.py`
- **Database**: Always use `database_simple.py` for Supabase operations
- **Testing**: Create `test_*.py` files for all new features

### Frontend Development:
- **Framework**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (no custom CSS files)
- **Components**: Check existing components before creating new ones
- **State**: Use React hooks and context, not Redux

## 📁 PROJECT STRUCTURE CLARIFICATION
**Important**: There are 3 UI-related directories with different purposes:

### 1. `web/` - Main Web Application
- **Purpose**: Complete React + Vite web app
- **Contains**: All pages, components, auth, dashboards
- **Tech**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, Vite
- **Port**: 5173 (Vite default)
- **Status**: ✅ Active development

### 2. `frontend/` - Bid Card Display System
- **Purpose**: Specialized bid card components for multi-channel display
- **Contains**: `BidCard.tsx` component with email/preview variants
- **Why Separate**: Used by Agent 2 for contractor outreach emails/SMS
- **Features**: Rich link previews, email-safe rendering
- **Status**: ✅ Working (needed for bid card URLs)

### 3. `mobile/` - Future React Native App
- **Purpose**: Placeholder for mobile app
- **Contains**: Empty directory structure
- **Status**: 🚧 Not implemented yet

## 🚨 CRITICAL BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS (NEW)

### Timing & Probability System Needed:
```
Example: User needs 4 lawn care bids within 2 days

System calculates:
- Tier 1 (Internal): 6 contractors (90% response rate)
- Tier 2 (Previous): 8 contractors (50% response rate) 
- Tier 3 (Cold): 12 contractors (20% response rate)

Check-in Schedule:
- 6 hours: How many responses? Launch wave 2 if needed
- 24 hours: How many responses? Launch wave 3 if needed  
- 48 hours: Escalate or extend deadline
```

This system is **CRITICAL** and currently **MISSING**.
