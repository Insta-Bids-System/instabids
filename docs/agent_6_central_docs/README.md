**Maintained by**: Agent 6 (Quality Gatekeeper)  
**Purpose**: Centralized system knowledge for all development agents  
**Location**: `docs/agent_6_central_docs/`

## üìã **DOCUMENTATION INDEX**

### üéØ **Core System Knowledge**

   - Complete architecture and component dependencies
   - How all 7 agents connect and interact
   - Database relationships and API integrations
   - **Read This**: To understand how your changes affect the system

2. **[CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md](CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md)**
   - Complete file structure with 100+ files mapped
   - What every directory and file contains
   - Where to find specific functionality
   - **Read This**: To locate any component or understand file organization

3. **[DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md](DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md)**
   - Standardized development process for all agents
   - Testing requirements and quality standards
   - Agent-specific workflows and responsibilities
   - **Read This**: Before making any code changes

### ü§ñ **Agent 6 Specific Knowledge**
- **[../ai-agents/agents/AGENT_6_UPDATED_SYSTEM_KNOWLEDGE.md](../../ai-agents/agents/AGENT_6_UPDATED_SYSTEM_KNOWLEDGE.md)**
  - Agent 6's complete understanding of the system
  - Quality priorities and maintenance tasks
  - System health monitoring procedures

## üìç **HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENTATION**

### **üîç For Any Agent Starting Work:**
1. **Start with**: `CLAUDE.md` in the root directory (build status)
2. **Read**: Your agent specification in `agent_specifications/`
3. **Review**: The 3 core docs above for complete context
4. **Check**: Admin dashboard at http://localhost:5173/admin/login for live system status

### **üìä For Understanding System Architecture:**
- Use `SYSTEM_INTERDEPENDENCY_MAP.md` to see how components connect
- Check database relationships and API dependencies
- Understand real-time monitoring integration

### **üìÅ For Finding Code:**
- Use `CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md` to locate any file or component
- See file purposes and responsibilities
- Find testing files and documentation

### **üõ†Ô∏è For Development Process:**
- Follow `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` for quality standards
- Use standardized testing and documentation practices
- Coordinate with other agents through proper channels

## üéØ **CRITICAL REMINDERS**

### **‚úÖ Always Do This:**
- Read these docs before starting work
- Use admin dashboard to monitor system health
- Follow the development workflow for all changes
- Update documentation when you make changes

### **‚ùå Never Do This:**
- Skip reading system documentation
- Make changes without understanding dependencies
- Ignore testing requirements
- Work without checking current system status
