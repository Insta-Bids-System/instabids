## 🚀 How to Use

### From Python Code (EAA Agent)
```python
from agents.eaa.agent import ExternalAcquisitionAgent

# Initialize agent with MCP email channel
eaa = ExternalAcquisitionAgent()

# Send personalized emails
result = eaa.start_campaign(
    bid_card_id='miami-lawn-care-123',
    contractors=contractor_list,
    channels=['email'],  # Uses MCP email channel
    urgency='standard'
)
```

### Direct MCP Tool Calls (From Claude)
```python
# Send custom email
mcp__instabids-email__send_email(
    to="contractor@example.com",
    subject="New Lawn Care Project - Miami ($200-$350)",
    body="Plain text content...",
    html="<html>Rich HTML content...</html>"
)

# Send notification
mcp__instabids-email__send_instabids_notification(
    to="contractor@example.com",
    type="new_bid",
    data={
        "project_name": "Lawn Care Service",
        "contractor_name": "Green Lawn Masters",
        # ... other fields
    }
)
```

## 🎉 Achievement Unlocked

We have successfully created an intelligent email system that:

1. **Sends unique emails** to each contractor (not mass emails)
2. **Personalizes content** with company names and contact info
3. **Tracks engagement** with unique URLs and message IDs
4. **Integrates seamlessly** with the campaign orchestration system
5. **Works with real MCP tools** (verified with actual tool calls)

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**: Configure MCP email server with production SMTP
2. **Analytics Integration**: Track click-through rates on unique URLs
3. **A/B Testing**: Test different email templates and messaging
4. **Response Tracking**: Connect email responses back to campaigns

## 🔍 Verification

To verify the implementation:

1. Check stored emails: `ai-agents/temp_email_storage/`
2. Run tests: `python test_mcp_email_integration.py`
3. View in MailHog: http://localhost:8080 (if configured)
4. Inspect unique URLs in each email
