## Key Design Decisions

### URL Structure
```

3. **No PII** - Homeowner info protected
4. **CTA** - "Claim this project" button
5. **Tracking** - View analytics

### Test Websites
1. **Simple Form** - Basic contact fields
2. **Multi-Step** - Wizard-style form
3. **Complex Form** - Validation & reCAPTCHA
4. **AJAX Form** - Modern JavaScript submission

## Implementation Timeline
- **Day 1**: Database & API setup
- **Day 2**: Landing page development
- **Day 3**: Test sites & WFA updates
- **Day 4**: Integration testing
- **Day 5**: Documentation & deployment

## Success Metrics
- 50%+ form fill success rate
- 20%+ bid card view rate
- 10%+ contractor response rate
- < 2 second page load time
