# Image Handling in Bid Cards - Complete Summary

## ✅ Test Results

The CIA → JAA → Bid Card flow now **successfully handles images**:

### 1. CIA Agent (Customer Interface Agent)
- **Fixed**: Now stores images in `collected_info['uploaded_photos']`
- **Change Made**: Added code to store images parameter in collected_info (line 237-239 in agent.py)
- **Result**: Images are preserved in conversation state

### 2. JAA Agent (Job Assessment Agent)  
- **Already Working**: The new_extractor.py correctly extracts images
- **Extracts**: `collected_info['uploaded_photos']` → `bid_card_data['images']`
- **Stores**: Images in bid_document JSONB field for database persistence

### 3. HTML Bid Card Generation
- **Working**: Generates email-safe HTML with image count
- **Example Output**: "Photos: 3 included" with link to view full details

## 📋 Test Evidence

```
SUMMARY: IMAGE HANDLING IN BID CARDS
================================================================================
1. Photos provided to CIA: 3
2. Photos stored by CIA: 3
3. Images extracted by JAA: 3
4. HTML bid card generated: YES

SUCCESS: All images flow through the system correctly!
```

## ⚠️ Frontend Integration Note

The BidCard.tsx component expects `photo_urls` but JAA provides `images`. 

**Solution**: When creating the bidCard object for BidCard.tsx, map the fields:

```javascript
const bidCard = {
  ...bidCardData,
  photo_urls: bidCardData.images,  // Map 'images' to 'photo_urls'
  // ... other fields
}
```

## 🎯 Complete Flow

1. **Frontend uploads images** → Gets URLs from Supabase storage
2. **CIA receives images** → Stores in `collected_info['uploaded_photos']`
3. **JAA extracts data** → Maps to `bid_card_data['images']`
4. **Database stores** → Saves in bid_document JSONB with all data
5. **HTML generation** → Creates email/SMS friendly bid cards
6. **BidCard.tsx** → Needs field mapping from `images` → `photo_urls`

## 📸 What Was Fixed

The CIA agent was receiving images but not storing them. Added this fix:

```python
# Store images in collected_info
if images and len(images) > 0:
    state['collected_info']['uploaded_photos'] = images
    print(f"[CIA] Added {len(images)} photos to collected_info")
```

This ensures images flow through the entire system to bid cards.
