## Design Workflow States

### Board Status Progression
1. **Collecting**: Gathering inspiration images and ideas
2. **Organizing**: Grouping images by room areas, styles, elements
3. **Refining**: Focusing vision and resolving conflicts
4. **Ready**: Prepared for project scoping with CIA

### Conversation Flow Management
```python
def _generate_suggestions(self, request, response):
    if request.board_status == "collecting":
        suggestions = [
            "Help me organize these images",
            "What style are these images?", 
            "Find similar inspiration",
            "What's my color palette?"
        ]
    elif request.board_status == "organizing":
        suggestions = [
            "Group by room areas",
            "Identify common elements",
            "Remove conflicting styles",
            "Create a mood board"
        ]
    # ... etc
```

## Intelligent Image Analysis

### Automatic Tag Generation
```python
def _generate_image_tags(self, room_type, message):
    base_tags = []
    
    # Room-specific tags
    if "kitchen" in room_type.lower():
        base_tags.extend(["kitchen", "cabinetry", "countertops", "appliances"])
    elif "bathroom" in room_type.lower():
        base_tags.extend(["bathroom", "tiles", "fixtures", "vanity"])
    
    # Style indicators from message
    if any(word in message.lower() for word in ["modern", "contemporary"]):
        base_tags.append("modern")
    if any(word in message.lower() for word in ["farmhouse", "rustic"]):
        base_tags.append("farmhouse")
    
    return unique_tags
```

### Design Pattern Recognition
```python
async def _analyze_images(self, images):
    analysis = {
        "style_summary": "Modern farmhouse with transitional elements",
        "primary_colors": ["White", "Gray", "Black accents", "Natural wood"],
        "key_elements": [
            "Shaker-style cabinets",
            "Marble or quartz countertops", 
            "Black hardware and fixtures",
            "Open shelving",
            "Pendant lighting"
        ],
        "materials_identified": [...],
        "estimated_style_cost": {
            "budget_friendly": "$15,000 - $25,000",
            "mid_range": "$25,000 - $45,000", 
            "high_end": "$45,000 - $75,000+"
        },
        "design_coherence": 0.85,
        "recommendations": [...]
    }
```

## Context-Aware Conversations

### Board Context Integration
```python
def _build_context(self, request):
    context_parts = []
    
    if request.board_title:
        context_parts.append(f"Board: {request.board_title}")
    if request.board_room_type:
        context_parts.append(f"Room Type: {request.board_room_type}")
    if request.images:
        context_parts.append(f"Images: {len(request.images)} uploaded")
        
    return "\n".join(context_parts)
```

### Intelligent Fallback Responses
When Claude API is unavailable, IRIS provides intelligent fallback responses:

#### Kitchen-Specific Expertise
```python
if "kitchen" in message_lower and "modern farmhouse" in message_lower:
    return """I can see you're interested in modern farmhouse style for your kitchen! 
    This is a fantastic choice that combines rustic charm with contemporary functionality.
    
    Key elements include:
    - White or light-colored Shaker-style cabinets
    - Black or oil-rubbed bronze hardware for contrast
    - Natural wood accents (floating shelves, islands, or beams)
    - Subway tile or shiplap backsplashes
    - Farmhouse sinks with bridge or gooseneck faucets
    """
```

#### Budget Guidance
```python
elif "budget" in message_lower:
    return f"""Let me help you understand typical budget ranges for {room_type} renovations:
    
    **Budget-Friendly ($15,000 - $25,000)**
    - Cabinet refacing or painting
    - Laminate or butcher block countertops
    - Standard fixtures and hardware
    
    **Mid-Range ($25,000 - $45,000)**
    - New semi-custom cabinets
    - Quartz or granite countertops
    - Quality appliances and fixtures
    
    **High-End ($45,000 - $75,000+)**
    - Custom cabinetry
    - Premium stone countertops
    - Professional-grade appliances
    """
```

## Image Upload Handling

### Automatic Tag Assignment
When users upload images, IRIS automatically:
1. **Asks Preference Questions**: "What aspects of this photo do you like?"
2. **Generates Relevant Tags**: Style, colors, materials, elements, room type, mood
3. **Provides Tag Display**: Shows auto-generated tags in response
4. **Offers Organization**: Suggests grouping and categorization

### Upload Response Example
```python
return f"""I can see you've uploaded {image_count} {category_text} image{'s' if image_count > 1 else ''} 
for your {request.board_room_type or 'project'}. These images show great taste!

**Auto-Generated Tags**: {tag_display}

What aspects of these images do you find most appealing? For example:
- The overall style and mood you want to achieve?
- Specific design elements that caught your eye?
- Colors and materials that inspire you?
- The feeling or atmosphere you want to create?
"""
```

## Integration with CIA Agent

### Project Readiness Assessment
When homeowners have refined their vision sufficiently, IRIS guides transition to CIA:

```python
if next_stage == "ready" or "project" in response_lower:
    suggestions[0] = "Connect with CIA agent"
```

### Vision Summary Creation
IRIS creates comprehensive vision summaries that CIA can use:
- **Style Direction**: Clear style identification and preferences
- **Color Palette**: Primary and accent color selections
- **Key Elements**: Must-have design features and materials
- **Budget Framework**: Realistic budget expectations
- **Priority List**: High-impact vs nice-to-have elements
